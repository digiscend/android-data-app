# Android Data App

## Introduction

Digiscend has data projects across the APEC region. Data mostly comprises of mining operations in Peru, Canada, Chile and Australia. This app lets you search and browse this data. The website https://digiscend.com already hosts this data freely.

## Background

 This app was my first Android app therefore, not as clean. This app can also be a sample starting point for new android developers. This app is stable and work-in-progress. It uses the new Digiscend API that is getting made along with this app. JSON API is used to access the data.
